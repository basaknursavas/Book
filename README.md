# Book 
Design a class called Book. This class is inherited from the Comparable interface and override the "compareTo" method. In this method, write the code that sorts the book from A to Z by name. Create 5 objects from this class and store the objects in a Set-type structure. Then use a data structure of the Set type for the second time and have it sort the books by the number of pages.

The book class consists of variables such as book name, number of pages, author's name, publication date.
